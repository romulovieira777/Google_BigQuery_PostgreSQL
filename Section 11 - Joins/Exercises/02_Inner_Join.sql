Retrieve the names of customers and the products they have ordered.

Table 1 - Customers:
    - The "Customers" table contains information about customers.
    - Each customer has a unique "CustomerID" as the primary key.
    - The "CustomerName" column stores the name of the customer.

Table 2 - Orders:
    - The "Orders" table contains information about customer orders.
    - Each order has a unique "OrderID" as the primary key.
    - The "CustomerID" column is a foreign key that links to the "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table, indicating which
      customer placed the order.
    - The "Product" column stores the product ordered.
    - The "Amount" column stores the order amount.
